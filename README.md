## KNOWN ISSUES
Since the purpose and scope of the project is POC:

1- No secrets management: this makes secrets and password stored in deployment, environment, Dockerfiles or even hardcoded.

2- Contributors are not available since we do not use public repositories for development purposes. This repository was created publicly to grant access to the code for the purpose of customer review only.
