## KNOWN ISSUES
Since the purpose and scope of the project is POC:

1- No secrets managemenet: this makes secrets and password stored in deployment, enviroment, Dockerfiles or even hardcoded.

2- Contributers are not avialable since we do not use public repositories for development purposes. This repository was created publically to grant access to the code for the perpose of customer review only.
